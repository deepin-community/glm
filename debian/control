Description: C++ library for OpenGL GLSL type-based mathematics
 OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) is a header only C++ mathematics library for graphics
 software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specification.
 .
 GLM provides classes and functions designed and implemented with the same
 naming conventions and functionalities as GLSL, so that when a programmer
 knows GLSL, he knows GLM as well, which makes it really easy to use.
 .
 This project isn't limited to GLSL features. An extension system, based on the
 GLSL extension conventions, provides extended capabilities: matrix
 transformations, quaternions, half-based types, random numbers, et cetera.
 .
 This library works perfectly together with OpenGL but it also ensures
 interoperability with other third party libraries and SDKs. It is a good
 candidate for software rendering (such as raytracing, rasterisation), image
 processing, physic simulations and any context that requires a simple and
 convenient mathematics library.
